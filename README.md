# Double_Slabs
Texture pack for Java Minecraft, replacing all double slabs with a custom texture. To use once installed, simply place a bottom and top slab of the same type in the same block and it will produce the texture stated below. Currently built for Java 1.15.2. See licencse for what you can and can't do with this texture pack. See below for the version history of this texture pack. Big Brick Quartz texture coming in 1.16, but the quartz texture in this pack is slightly different as it was made earlier. When 1.16 is released, I will change the Quartz textures in this pack.
